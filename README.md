# DirectX Practice

I'm learning [DirectX11](resources/tutorial/Direct3D11Tutorials) and I want to try and get it working with Go.

While I do this, I'm also figuring out how to create [DirectX11 bindings](vendor/github.com/silbinarywolf/d3d11) as I go, using [gonutz's DirectX9 bindings](https://github.com/gonutz/d3d9) as an example.

I'm putting this up publically is so that others can take these incomplete DirectX11 bindings and continue the work if I pause or stop for any reason.
